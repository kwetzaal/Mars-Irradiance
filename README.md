As Martian exploration and settlement becomes more probable and possible, energy supply and storage is a pressing issue. 
Based on previous missions and data, current and future missions will have some element of solar power to run rovers, facilities, etc. 
We will explore the energy yield potential of solar farms in the Martian climate. 
The relevant questions will be: What is the energy harvest potential of PV farms across Mars? What kind of cell technology will be best suited for Marsâ€™climate?

This Github repository contains the necessary calculations to consider the atmospheric conditions on Mars to derive solar panel efficieny and energy generation under those given conditions.
All the data necessary are found on the Mars Climate Database. 
Please obtain the following from MCD at all latitudes and all longitudes with a solar longitude of your choosing:
  
    Solar Zenith Angle
 
    Daily Mean Dust Column Visible Optical Depth
  
    Incident Solar Flux on Horizontal Surface

DNI Calc: calculates the Direct Normal component of solar irradiace.

DHI Calc: calculates the Diffuse Horizontal component of solar irradiance
